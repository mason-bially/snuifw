This is a **S**imple **N**ative **UI** **F**rame**w**ork intended for build simple UIs for native (C/C++) projects.

## Building

This library uses BAZEL as it's build system. In fact the main purpose of this library is to pull a number of useful libraries togeather with BAZEL.

### System Dependencies 

Here we list any system specific dependencies (while we build all libraries from source, some libraries that are operating system specific, and so we rely on their development environments).

#### Linux

Install the following dependencies with your package manager (listed here for debian):

`sudo apt-get install xorg-dev`
